# whisper-speech-to-text project
whisper-speech-to-text ai model

## Description
This project leverages OpenAI's Whisper model to convert speech into text accurately. It supports english language and provides transcription for both live and pre-recorded audio. Designed for accessibility, research, and natural language processing tasks, this project demonstrates the power of AI in real-world applications.

## Features
- Accurate Speech Recognition: Powered by OpenAI's Whisper model.
- Flexible Input: Works with live audio streams or pre-recorded files.
- User-friendly Interface: Simplified commands for seamless interaction.
- Customizable: Options to fine-tune or adapt the model for specific use cases.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   -bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whisper-speech-to-text.git
   cd whisper-speech-to-text

2. Set up a Python environment:
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
   -bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
 
3. Install dependencies:
   -bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Download the Whisper model:
   Use OpenAI's whisper Python library to fetch the model:
   -bash
   pip install openai-whisper
   whisper --model small

## Usage
### Transcribing a Pre-recorded Audio File
Run the script and specify the audio file as input:
-bash
python transcribe.py --audio-file path/to/audio/file.wav

### Live Transcription
For live audio transcription, use the following command:
-bash
python live_transcription.py


## Examples
### Transcription Output
Input: A recorded `.wav` file with the sentence:  
*"Hello, this is a test for Whisper speech-to-text."*

Output:
Hello, this is a test for Whisper speech-to-text.
